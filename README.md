A Rothko typically refers to a painting by Mark Rothko, a famous American abstract expressionist artist known for his color field paintings. His works are characterized by:

Large canvases

Rectangular blocks of color

Soft, blurred edges

Deep emotional resonance

Key Features of a Rothko Painting:
Often consists of two or three stacked rectangles of color

Uses rich, luminous color combinations

Designed to evoke spiritual or emotional experiences

Meant to be viewed up close, so the viewer is almost "enveloped" by the color

Example:
A typical Rothko might show a large canvas with a deep red rectangle over a black one, both floating against a maroon background. There are no distinct figures or shapesâ€”just the emotional impact of the colors.
